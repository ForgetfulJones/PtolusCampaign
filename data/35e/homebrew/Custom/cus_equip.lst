Pressurized launcher		COST:420	WT:5		SPROP:This device can project an object with great force. Although one could use it as a weapon, this is not the standard use, as firearms are far more efficient. Instead, adventurers employ it most often to fire grapnels with attached ropes up to one hundred feet with great force and accuracy, even anchoring them into a stone wall. If it does not need to embed itself, the grapnel can travel up to two hundred feet. If used as a weapon, it inflicts 2d6 points of damage to a single foe up to one hundred feet away (apply a –2 penalty to attack rolls made with it).

Bayonet				COST:3		WT:1		SPROP:The wielder can use this blade as a dagger or affix it to any rifle, allowing the rifle to be used as a shortspear that cannot be thrown.
Blast Axe (Pistol Axe)		COST:300	WT:3		SPROP:This strange weapon is like a long-barreled dragon pistol. Its reinforced barrel ends in an axeblade. One can fire it like a regular pistol, then use it as a handaxe.
Pistol Shield			COST:300	WT:10		SPROP:This heavy shield has a built-in dragon pistol, with the barrel facing straight out. The wielder can fire the pistol and then draw a melee weapon and charge into a fight.
Powered Bow +1			COST:400	WT:9		SPROP:Powered longbows are engineassisted mighty bows that do not require high strength to use. As with mighty bows, the bonus applies only to damage. The bonus does not stack with the archer’s normal Strength bonus. Powered bows weigh three times as much as normal bows and their price varies, as shown below. Powered Mighty Longbow Price (+1 Strength bonus)

Steam Armor				COST:18000	WT:80		SPROP:Steam-powered armor protects a wearer as plate armor and adds a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength due to its built-in strengthaugmenting mechanisms. It requires firestone (see “Maintenance and Fuel,” page 565).
								
Battle Cart				COST:15000	WT:900		SPROP:This massive vehicle looks like a wagon without horses. It measures ten feet long and about six feet wide (size Large). Its sides are armor plated with small slits for archers or riflemen. The cart has a hardness of 10 and 200 hp. A battle cart is steam-powered (it requires firestone; see “Maintenance and Fuel,” page 565) and can travel up to twenty miles per hour over flat, smooth, terrain. The carts are usually outfitted with a ram or a spiked plate for running down foes on foot (inflicting 3d6 points of damage at full speed; a Reflex save, DC 15, negates the damage). One character must drive the cart. While it is moving, controlling the cart is a fullround action. A Dexterity check (DC 15) is required to avoid obstacles when moving at full speed.
Glider Wings			COST:1400	WT:40		SPROP:A Medium creature can strap on these aerodynamic wings to glide through the air. A character can take ranks in Ride (glider wings) to use them even better. On a still or relatively calm day, the glider travels in a straight line for twice as far as it drops, so a character wearing the wings and jumping from a forty-foot-tall tower can travel eighty feet laterally before landing. On a very windy day, a character can travel much farther (almost indefinitely) if she makes a Ride check (DC 15) every ten minutes. Landing safely requires another check (DC 12). Failure results in 1d6 points of damage to both the character and the wings, assuming the wearer dropped at least ten feet. Made of light wood and canvas, the wings have a hardness of 3 and 10 hit points. Their wingspan measures fifteen feet.
Hot-Air Balloon			COST:3500	WT:300		SPROP:With a powerful furnace beneath it, a large balloon can carry aloft up to 2,000 lbs. A single character can operate the balloon, controlling its altitude and direction. The latter, of course, depends greatly on the wind’s direction and speed. The balloon itself measures about forty feet across and sixty feet high. The basket below is about eight feet in diameter. A hot-air balloon has a hardness of 1 and 5 hit points. The basket has a hardness of 3 and 30 hitpoints. Price (with furnace)
Steamboat				COST:18000	WT:180000	SPROP:A steamboat is a keelboat (fifty- to seventy-five-foot-long vessel) that does not require wind or oar to move. A powerful steam engine fuels its massive paddlewheel. While these boats can’t operate in the King’s River (too many waterfalls), they are sometimes seen out in the Bay of Ptolus.
Steam Cart (Large)		COST:8000	WT:600		SPROP:This vehicle resembles a battle cart, but it is not armored or fitted with spikes, ram plates, or the like. With it, a person can haul up to 1,500 lbs. of cargo or passengers. Its top speed is only ten miles per hour. A driver operates it just like a battle cart, and it likewise requires firestone to use (see “Maintenance and Fuel,” page 565).
Steam Cart (Medium)		COST:5000	WT:500		SPROP:This wheeled chair has a steam motor and room enough for equipment or a passenger up to 250 lbs. Controlling the cart in motion is a full-round action. It can move five miles per hour but requires firestone (see “Maintenance and Fuel,” page 565).
Steam Cart (Small)		COST:3000	WT:300		SPROP:This is basically a wheeled chair with a steam motor. Controlling the cart in motion is a full-round action. It can move up to five miles per hour and requires firestone to use (see “Maintenance and Fuel,” page 565).
